String starts with capital "S" that denotes it is a class unlike primitive data types and it needs to be instanciated each time a new String is created.(Abstracted in Java).

It is a class so it will have methods as well. (Default methods of String)

By default String is immutatble, need to create a new String, can't append to original string or remove.
