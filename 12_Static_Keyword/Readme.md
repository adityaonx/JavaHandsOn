    //Mutable String
    //By starting with a reasonable buffer size, StringBuffer avoids frequent reallocations.
    //This is especially beneficial when you need to modify a string multiple times, as each modification doesnâ€™t create a new object
    //Buffer means an extra space of (default) 16 characters
